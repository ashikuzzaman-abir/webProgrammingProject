*File management rules:

	img/ 			-> folder should containe only image files
	  img/imgDataBase/	-> folder for containing uploaded data to the server
	  img/imgPage/		-> folder for website end images such as icons etc,
				   which we will use for building front end in the website
	src/			-> folder is for all coding stuff aka source codes

We will use HTML, CSS, Javascript and php

Naming rules:
	For HTML & CSS->
		use lower case letters for setting class and id names
		dont use space, instead use hyphen(-) in multi word names, example -> "box-left"
		logically set each element's class, id and name fields name
		don't use any mumbo jumbo type names
		set the id and name field's name same for each elements
		and it should be unique for each and every elements
		css class definations must be design for multiple use, keep it in mind
		you will understand it in the group meeting when we will discuss
	For Javascript and PHP->
		use camelCase typing naming rule for variable and function names example ->
			var totalStudent = 12;
			$dateAndTime = date();
			function myFunction () {};
